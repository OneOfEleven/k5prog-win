# k5prog-win
A windows GUI version of k5prog.

Original k5prog is https://github.com/sq5bpf/k5prog by Jacek.

It just basically allows you to save and restore the K5/K6's configuration (EEPRPM area) and also to reprogram the CPU's flash area with new firmware.

The firmware file you load can be the usual encrypted Quangshengs .bin firmware file or say an unencrypted .bin firmware file from the https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware project.

This GUI software is wriiten/compiled using the old Borland C++ Builder v6 system, but can also be updated to the newer embarcadero cbuilder free starter system.
