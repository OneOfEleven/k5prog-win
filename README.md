# k5prog-win
A windows GUI version of k5prog.

Use at your own risk !

Original k5prog is https://github.com/sq5bpf/k5prog by Jacek.

It just basically allows you to save and restore the K5/K6's configuration ('EEPROM' area) and also to reprogram the CPU's flash area with new firmware.

The firmware file you load can be the usual encrypted Quangshengs .bin firmware file or an unencrypted .bin firmware file from say the https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware project, it takes a quick look at the file when loaded and decrypts/processes it if need be.

This program is wriiten/compiled using the old Borland C++ Builder v6 system, but can also be updated to the newer embarcadero cbuilder free starter system.

Feel free to convert it to a multi-platform/OS Qt project or such like.
